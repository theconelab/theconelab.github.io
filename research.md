### What do we study in CONE LAB?

  In the CONE LAB we study how human brains learn language, represent linguistic information, and are shaped by our different learning experiences. 
  We're especially interested in the solutions that learners find when provided conflicting information about categories. A very common example of 
  this experience is bilingualism, where people learn not only two languages' worth of information, but they also manage conflicts in the ways that 
  these languages organize the world. Our work includes all kinds of language learners, from babies to adults, and many levels of proficiency. We use 
  behavioral, computational, and brain imaging methods (like EEG, fNIRS, and fMRI) to study the cognitive and neural systems that represent 
  linguistic knowledge in people who speak one, two, or many languages.

### Research Areas
**Statistical Learning** - Statistical learning is a mechanism for finding patterns (or "causal structures") in the environment, such as the order in which certain events occur (like what syllables go together in speech) or the links between sounds and images (like the names of objects). This mechanism is available from infancy, and probably supports some of babies' first discoveries about language. However, statistical learning is also active throughout childhood and adulthood. We are interested in how this ability to find patterns helps children learn how to read, how differences in this ability contribute to different outcomes in literacy, and whether statistical learning experiments do a good job of representing the different ways children learn to read in different educational contexts. One of those contexts is bilingulism, where children or adults know two different languages (and thus, two different patterns). We explore how statistical learning mechanisms can be applied when two artificial languages provide different, competing patterns. These studies investigate how a simple learning mechanism like SL might contribute to the very complicated inferences that learners (infants, children, and adults) make as they navigate between languages.
