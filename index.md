  In the CONE LAB we study how human brains learn language, represent linguistic information, and are shaped by our different learning experiences. 
  We're especially interested in the solutions that learners find when provided conflicting information about categories. A very common example of 
  this experience is bilingualism, where people learn not only two languages' worth of information, but they also manage conflicts in the ways that 
  these languages organize the world. Our work includes all kinds of language learners, from babies to adults, and many levels of proficiency. We use 
  behavioral, computational, and brain imaging methods (like EEG, fNIRS, and fMRI) to study the cognitive and neural systems that represent 
  linguistic knowledge in people who speak one, two, or many languages.
