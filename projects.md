## Current and Recent Projects

### How do words shape our judgments about objects?

Have you ever noticed that certain objects have many different names? And there is usually one name that just seems more fitting for that object? In this study, we are looking into this phenomenon to better understand how object-categorization varies within and between languages. We ask participants to name objects and rate how well they fit in different categories. We have found that these ratings depend on how people name the objects, suggesting that having a label like "cup" or "chair" for an object shapes our judgements about the object itself.

### Do computational models of words accurately describe bilingual object categorization?

Can word-embedding models that learn by processing millions or billions of websites and articles predict how humans perceive the connection between two words? We created many pairs of words (ex. table vs. chair, bag vs. boot) and asked our monolingual & bilingual participants to rate how similar they are. Then, we compared AI-generated ratings to our human data. We found that even though English monolingual and Chinese-English bilinguals correlate differently with our model, these algorithms still may not capture the more nuanced differences between our two groups.
